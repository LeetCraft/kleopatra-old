    body: [
      "**PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** — The original encryption software created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991. It was initially distributed as freeware, then commercialized, and is now owned by Broadcom (formerly Symantec). PGP the product is proprietary software primarily for enterprise use.",
      "**OpenPGP** — The open standard (defined in RFC 4880, updated in RFC 9580) derived from PGP. It specifies how key formats, message encryption, signatures, and key exchange should work. OpenPGP is maintained by the IETF and is what virtually all modern 'PGP' tools implement.",
      "**GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** — A free, open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard by the GNU Project. GPG is what most people install when they 'install PGP.' It's a command-line tool available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.",
      "**Kleopatra** — A graphical key manager that provides a user-friendly interface for GPG on Windows (via Gpg4win). Kleopatra implements OpenPGP via GPG under the hood.",
      "**Kleopatra.app** — A browser-based OpenPGP tool using OpenPGP.js — a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP standard. It's fully compatible with keys and messages from GPG, Kleopatra desktop, ProtonMail, and any other OpenPGP tool.",
      "In practice: when someone says 'send me your PGP key,' they mean an OpenPGP public key. Any tool — GPG, Kleopatra, ProtonMail, Kleopatra.app — can generate and use compatible keys. The names 'PGP,' 'GPG,' and 'OpenPGP' are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation.",
